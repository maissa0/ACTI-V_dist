# Eureka Server

This branch contains the Eureka Server configuration for our microservices architecture. Eureka is a service registry that enables service discovery, allowing microservices to find and communicate with each other without hardcoding hostnames or IPs.

## 🌐 What is Eureka?

Eureka is a REST-based service registry from Netflix, used in Spring Cloud for locating services for the purpose of load balancing and failover of middle-tier servers.
